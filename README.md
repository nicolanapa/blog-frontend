# Blog Frontend

This Project is inspirated by this [project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-nodejs-blog-api).
<br />
<br />
It's divided into two applications:

-   A normal Blog made to be viewed and where you can comment
-   An admin Blog where you can create posts (as a blogAuthor) and manage various things such as Posts, Comments or Users

Some live examples can be found hosted here:

-   [blog-api](https://blog-api-u57b.onrender.com/) (back-end repo [blog-api](https://github.com/nicolanapa/blog-api))
-   [normalUsage](https://blog-frontend-normalusage.netlify.app/) Subdirectory
-   [blogAdmin](https://blog-frontend-blogadmin.netlify.app/) Subdirectory

To be able to try the blogAdmin application and the blogAuthor type of User here's the BLOG_AUTHOR_SECRET_KEY secret variable
